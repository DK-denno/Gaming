      <h2>DEFCON</h2>

      <img src="image/defcon.jpg" alt="defcon" width="800" height="500"></br>

      Games with body counts that reach into the hundreds are as common as a Capcom</br>
      game with zombies in it but how many games can you name which boast a kill count</br>
      in the tens of millions? Cities are wiped from the face of the planet,</br>
      entire continents are crushed by nuclear onslaught and the Earth's population is</br>
      decimated as six superpowers wage war on each other. Everybody dies.</br>
      That, in a nutshell, is DEFCON, the explosive new strategy game from </br>
      Introversion - the developer behind the critically-adored Darwinia and</br>
      lesser-known, but equally brilliant, Uplink.</br>
      The aim of the game is simple: cause mass destruction on a global scale by</br>
      launching nuclear attacks on rival superpowers while, at the same time, protecting</br>
      your own borders from enemy strikes. Refreshingly, it's as easy to play as it is to</br>
      explain, with many of the elements that tend to overcomplicate strategy</br>
      games - such as resource management - stripped away to shift focus onto </br>
      killing every last living, breathing person on the planet.</br>

      However, before the bloodbath begins, the conditions of war must first be determined.</br>
      There are six superpowers fighting for global domination, these being Asia, Russia,</br>
      North America, South America, Africa and Europe. Players each choose a faction to side</br>
      with and the remaining powers are either allocated to CPU players or left out of the game entirely.</br>
      As such there's tremendous scope for playing DEFCON on a number of levels, from straightforward</br>
      one-on-one conflicts - an obvious starting point for new players - to six-player all-against-all bun</br>
      fights best left for those who know their silos from their subs.
