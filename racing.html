  <p>Asphalt 8: Airborne is a 2013 racing video game, developed by Gameloft Barcelona and published by Gameloft as part of the Asphalt series. It was released on August 22, 2013 for iOS and Android, November 13 for Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8, January 15, 2014 for BlackBerry 10 and April 5, 2015 for Tizen. The game's successor Asphalt 9: Legends was announced on 26th February 2018.</p>
  <h2>features</h2>
  <p>Gameloft’s Asphalt 8: Airborne comes equipped with a garage of new features, including dynamic weather, new maps, and upgraded physics. Cars are more weighted, braking is more accurate, and handling it more easily differentiated between models. Wanna take that F12 Berlinetta up to top speed? No more plowing through corners and continuing to build speed. You now have to properly brake, power through the apex, and then give it full throttle on the oncoming straight. On the opposite side of the spectrum, you’ll see massive air,crazy stunts, and mind boggling slides. Gran Turismo fanboys, eat your heart out.

Up next are locations, where we see some truly interesting scenery, ranging from Nevada, to Tokyo, London and even Iceland. We all know Iceland has some incredibly crazy racetracks, right? Don’t doubt… the developers at Asphalt 8 have made it work. The best part of this news is that some of these tracks will be rain-soaked (hydroplaning in a Pagani? Seems safe) ice covered, and even ruggedly dirty.</p>

<h1>Trackmania <i class="fa fa-star checked"></i><i class="fa fa-star checked"></i><i class="fa fa-star checked"></i><i class="fa fa-star checked"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i></h1>
<p>TrackMania is a series of racing games for the Windows PC, Nintendo DS, Nintendo Wii, Sony Playstation 4 and the Microsoft Xbox One platforms, developed by the French team Nadeo for the PC. Instead of following the usual trend of choosing a set car and track to play the game, in TrackMania the players can create their own tracks using a "building block" process similar to that of the 1984 game Excitebike, the 1985 game Racing Destruction Set and the 1990 game Stunts.

Unlike most other racing games,The game revolves around the fictitious Horizon Festival, a street racing event set in the state of Colorado. The game incorporates many different game-play aspects from previous Forza Motorsport titles, like the large variety of cars, realistic physics and high definition graphics. The aim is to progress through the game by means of obtaining wristbands via winning races, while also increasing their popularity level by driving fast, destroying property, and performing other stunts and antics. It features the physics of Forza Motorsport 4, which have been optimised to work on the 65 variants of terrain said to be present in the game. Players can drive off-road in select areas, while others, such as large cliffs, are limited by guardrails or other means.[3]Forza Horizon is an open-world racing video game for Microsoft's Xbox 360 video game console developed by Playground Games in association with Turn 10 Studios. The game is the fifth release under the Forza series, although it was (at the time of its release) a spin-off of the original Forza Motorsport title scheme.[2] Forza Horizon 2 was released in 2014 and Forza Horizon 3 in 2016; Forza Horizon 4 is scheduled for October 2018.

Players may choose to respawn at any time if they land upside down, leave the track or get off to a poor start. In multiplayer games, however, multiple cars race on the same track and cannot collide or otherwise influence each other.</p>
