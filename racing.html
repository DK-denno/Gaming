  <p>Asphalt 8: Airborne is a 2013 racing video game, developed by Gameloft Barcelona and published by Gameloft as part of the Asphalt series. It was released on August 22, 2013 for iOS and Android, November 13 for Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8, January 15, 2014 for BlackBerry 10 and April 5, 2015 for Tizen. The game's successor Asphalt 9: Legends was announced on 26th February 2018.</p>
  <h2>features</h2>
  <p>Gameloft’s Asphalt 8: Airborne comes equipped with a garage of new features, including dynamic weather, new maps, and upgraded physics. Cars are more weighted, braking is more accurate, and handling it more easily differentiated between models. Wanna take that F12 Berlinetta up to top speed? No more plowing through corners and continuing to build speed. You now have to properly brake, power through the apex, and then give it full throttle on the oncoming straight. On the opposite side of the spectrum, you’ll see massive air,crazy stunts, and mind boggling slides. Gran Turismo fanboys, eat your heart out.

Up next are locations, where we see some truly interesting scenery, ranging from Nevada, to Tokyo, London and even Iceland. We all know Iceland has some incredibly crazy racetracks, right? Don’t doubt… the developers at Asphalt 8 have made it work. The best part of this news is that some of these tracks will be rain-soaked (hydroplaning in a Pagani? Seems safe) ice covered, and even ruggedly dirty.</p>

<h1>Trackmania <i class="fa fa-star checked"></i><i class="fa fa-star checked"></i><i class="fa fa-star checked"></i><i class="fa fa-star checked"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i></h1>
<p> TrackMania is a series of racing games for the Windows PC, Nintendo DS, Nintendo Wii, Sony Playstation 4 and the Microsoft Xbox One platforms, developed by the French team Nadeo for the PC. Instead of following the usual trend of choosing a set car and track to play the game, in TrackMania the players can create their own tracks using a "building block" process similar to that of the 1984 game Excitebike, the 1985 game Racing Destruction Set and the 1990 game Stunts.

Unlike most other racing games, the TrackMania series lets the player race a track as many times as they want within a time limit. Players may choose to respawn at any time if they land upside down, leave the track or get off to a poor start. In multiplayer games, however, multiple cars race on the same track and cannot collide or otherwise influence each other.</p>
<h2>features</h2>
<p>features more realistic graphics and contains three environments: Island, Bay, and Coast. As in the original game, each has a unique car to fit the environment's characteristics. "Island" features fast sports cars which can turn sharply on mostly wide roads while "Bay" has bouncy cars with less traction, making accidental oversteering more likely. "Coast" features slower cars with little traction and small roads where cars are able to drift through corners. The game was built on an overhauled engine for better visuals and Internet connectivity with tracks that include skinnable advertisement panels</p>

<h1>Forza Horizon <i class="fa fa-star checked"></i><i class="fa fa-star checked"></i><i class="fa fa-star checked"></i><i class="fa fa-star checked"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i></h1>
<p>The game revolves around the fictitious Horizon Festival, a street racing event set in the state of Colorado. The game incorporates many different game-play aspects from previous Forza Motorsport titles, like the large variety of cars, realistic physics and high definition graphics. The aim is to progress through the game by means of obtaining wristbands via winning races, while also increasing their popularity level by driving fast, destroying property, and performing other stunts and antics. It features the physics of Forza Motorsport 4, which have been optimised to work on the 65 variants of terrain said to be present in the game. Players can drive off-road in select areas, while others, such as large cliffs, are limited by guardrails or other means.[3]Forza Horizon is an open-world racing video game for Microsoft's Xbox 360 video game console developed by Playground Games in association with Turn 10 Studios. The game is the fifth release under the Forza series, although it was (at the time of its release) a spin-off of the original Forza Motorsport title scheme.[2] Forza Horizon 2 was released in 2014 and Forza Horizon 3 in 2016; Forza Horizon 4 is scheduled for October 2018.

<h1>Mario Kart <i class="fa fa-star checked"></i><i class="fa fa-star checked"></i><i class="fa fa-star checked"></i><i class="fa fa-star checked"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i></h1>
<p>Mario Kart 8 (マリオカート8 Mario Kāto Eito) is a kart racing video game and the eighth major installment in the Mario Kart series, developed and published by Nintendo for their Wii U home video game console. The game was first announced at E3 2013 and released worldwide in May 2014.

Like in other games in the series, in Mario Kart 8, players control characters from the Mario franchise and participate in kart racing on various race tracks, using a variety of items to hinder opponents or gain advantages in the race </p>
<h2>features</h2>
<p>There are five different Battle Mode types:

<em>Balloon Battle:</em> The classic mode where players use items to pop opponents' balloons or steal them in order to score points. This mode now uses the point-based set-up seen in Mario Kart Wii, and Mario Kart 7, rather than the last man standing set-up of Super Mario Kart, Mario Kart DS, and Mario Kart 8.
<em>Renegade Roundup:</em> A new mode in the vein of "cops and robbers", with the racers being divided into two teams. One team, known as "The Authorities", has to use Potted Piranha Plants (which are permanently attached to the front of their vehicle and only serve to capture the opposing team; they do not operate like the regular item) in order to capture players from the other team, known as "The Renegades". Captured Renegades are placed into one of several jail cells floating above various points on the stage. Remaining Renegades can free their teammates by driving over a key switch placed below the jail cells. The Renegades win if at least one member is still running free when time runs out, and the Authorities win if all of the Renegades get captured. All Authority team members also temporarily lose their ability to capture after being hit by an item and Renegades receive a speed boost when they are freed from the cells.
<em>Bob-omb Blast:</em> A returning mode from Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, in which players attack one another using Bob-ombs to score points and can carry up to 10 Bob-ombs. This version follows all of the same rules as Balloon Battle, the difference being that the only items are Bob-ombs.
Coin Runners:</em> Originating in Mario Kart Wii, this mode was last seen in Mario Kart 7. Players must collect Coins scattered across the course in order to have the most by the end of the match. Plays more akin to the Mario Kart Wii version of the mode, with players having no limit to the amount of coins they can collect, as opposed to the 10-coin limit in the Mario Kart 7 version.
<em>Shine Thief:</em> Another returning mode from Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, one player must retrieve a Shine Sprite and keep hold of it for about 20 seconds, while the opponents use items against whoever has the Shine to force that player to drop it. The driver holding the shine sprite has a slightly reduced top speed. In Team play, one team must collectively manage to hold on to the Shine for about 30 seconds.</p>
